# Generating-Keywords-for-Google-Ads
Automatically generate keywords for a search engine marketing campaign using Python. Inspired from a DataCamp project of the same name.

The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.

The task is to create a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns of a ficticious digital marketing agency for their sofas section.
